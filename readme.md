## IdeaPad - Jumpstart Labs tutorial

A simple Sinatra app, guided by the [Jumpstart Labs tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/idea_box.html#i1:-recording-ideas).  

Why: after playing about with websockets and building a simple server/client pair as part of the Odin Project, I was keen to linger on that topic for a bit and have a look at how Ruby's web frameworks work in a bit more detail.  In particular, I was keen to look at the basics in a bit more depth before going near Rails, so I took brief detour to take a look at Sinatra.

The app is nothing special and as yet I have not added anything of my own.  It's a simple CRUD interface with a simple YAML datastore.  This was my first look at building an app in the modular style (though the routes are still together in monolithic fashion).  

I've taken the first small step to building in some proper tests - these would need to be in place before pushing on with refactoring and building in some proper functionality.  I will come back to the app once I'm more comfortable with testing.
